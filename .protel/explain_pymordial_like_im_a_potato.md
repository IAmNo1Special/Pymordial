# Explain Pymordial Like I'm a Potato 🥔

**Project**: Pymordial  
**Target Audience**: People who think "Python" is just a snake and "ADB" is a typo.

## 1. What is this thing?

Imagine you have a really boring mobile game you need to play for 12 hours a day to win. Maybe you need to tap a "Battle" button every 5 seconds, or fish for digital carp until your thumbs fall off.

**Pymordial is a robot thumb.**

It runs on your computer, watches your BlueStacks emulator (that program that plays Android games on PC), and plays the game for you. It sees what's on the screen, reads the text, and clicks the buttons, all while you go sleep, eat, or touch grass.

## 2. The Pizza Analogy 🍕

Think of playing a mobile game like making a pizza.
- **You (The Human)**: You have to look at the dough, put on sauce, add cheese, and put it in the oven. It's manual labor.
- **BlueStacks**: This is the kitchen counter where the pizza is made.
- **Pymordial**: This is a **Master Chef Robot** you hired.

You tell the robot: *"Chef, when you see the 'Battle' button (the dough), punch it. If you see 'Victory' (the cooked pizza), do a little dance and start over."*

The robot doesn't get tired. The robot doesn't need bathroom breaks. The robot will make 5,000 pizzas in a row with dead-eyed precision.

## 3. What problems does it solve?

1.  **Boredom**: Grinding in games is boring. Pymordial does the boring stuff.
2.  **Human Error**: You might miss a button press because you sneezed. Pymordial doesn't sneeze.
3.  **Time**: You have a life. Pymordial does not. It gives you your time back.

## 4. Who is this for?

- **Gamers**: Who want to farm resources while they sleep.
- **QA Testers**: Who need to test if an app crashes after being opened 1,000 times.
- **Lazy Geniuses**: Who would rather spend 10 hours coding a bot than 1 hour playing a boring game.

## 5. Value Proposition (Why should I care?)

**"We turn electricity into digital loot."**

If your time is worth more than $0/hour, Pymordial pays for itself immediately (since it's free). It turns your computer into an employee that works 24/7 for the cost of electricity.

## 6. Common Questions from Normal People

**Q: Is this hacking?**
A: No. It's just clicking buttons really fast. It doesn't break into the game's servers; it just looks at the screen like you do.

**Q: Can it play ANY game?**
A: Yes, if you teach it how. It's like a dog; you have to train it to "sit" (click start) and "stay" (wait for loading).

**Q: Will it take over the world?**
A: Unlikely. Right now it struggles if a pop-up ad appears in a weird spot. Humanity is safe for another week.

## Outstanding Questions & Blockers

- **Does the user want a GUI?** Currently, this is a code-only tool. If "normal people" are actually going to use this, they might need a pretty window with buttons, not a Python script.
- **Is this strictly for BlueStacks?** The name implies "Primal" origins, but right now it's married to BlueStacks. Can we divorce them later?
