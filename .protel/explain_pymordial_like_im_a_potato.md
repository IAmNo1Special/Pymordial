# Pymordial: Explained Like You're a Potato 🥔

*For people who see code and feel their soul leave their body*

---

## What the Heck Is This Thing?

Pymordial is **a robot that plays mobile games for you**.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

You know how you have to grind for hours in mobile games, tapping the same buttons, doing the same boring tasks over and over? Pymordial does that grinding while you sleep, eat, or actually live your life.

## The Pizza Delivery Analogy 🍕

Imagine you run a pizzeria, but you're tired of delivering pizzas yourself. So you hire a delivery driver.

- **BlueStacks** = Your delivery car (the Android emulator running on your PC)
- **Pymordial** = Your delivery driver (the automation brain)
- **ADB** = The steering wheel and pedals (how the driver controls the car)
- **OCR** = The driver's eyes (reading signs, addresses, and instructions)
- **Your Game** = The pizza order (what needs to be delivered/completed)

The driver (Pymordial) gets in the car (BlueStacks), uses the controls (ADB) to navigate, reads signs (OCR) to know where to go, and delivers your pizza (completes your game tasks).

**You just sit back and get paid.**

## Who Should Use This?

✅ **Mobile game players** who want to automate repetitive tasks  
✅ **Developers** building game automation tools  
✅ **QA testers** who need to automate app testing  
✅ **Anyone** tired of mindless screen tapping  

❌ **Not for**: People looking for cheat software (this is automation, not hacking)

## Value Proposition (Plain English)

> "Play your favorite mobile games... without actually playing them."

Pymordial handles the boring grind so you can enjoy the fun parts. Think of it as hiring a very reliable, very caffeinated assistant who never sleeps and never complains.

## Common Questions from Non-Techies

### "Is this cheating?"
It's automation, not hacking. You're not modifying the game—you're just automating actions you could do manually. Think of it like using a dishwasher instead of washing dishes by hand.

### "Will I get banned?"
Maybe. Games have anti-cheat systems. Pymordial tries to act human-like, but there's always risk. Use at your own discretion.

### "Do I need to be a programmer?"
To use pre-made bots? No. To build your own? Yes, you'll need some Python knowledge.

### "Does it work with [insert game]?"
Pymordial works with ANY Android game running in BlueStacks. You just need to configure it for your specific game.

### "Is it free?"
Yes, it's open source. Free as in beer AND free as in freedom.

## The One-Sentence Pitch

**"Pymordial is like Tesla Autopilot for mobile games—it handles the boring driving so you can focus on the scenery."**

## Outstanding Questions & Blockers

- Does the target audience care about cross-platform support (Mac/Linux)?
- What games are most commonly automated? (Could tailor examples)
- Are there specific anti-cheat concerns to address in documentation?
- Should there be a "getting started without coding" tutorial?
